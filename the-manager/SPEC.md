## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Hierarchical Task/Initiative Structure
- **Multi-level hierarchy:** Initiative → Sub-initiative → Task → Subtask
- **Unlimited depth** for drilling down
- **Parent-child relationships** maintained in data model

### 3.2 Dual View Modes

#### A. Mind Map View
- Visual representation of initiatives and their relationships
- Collapsible/expandable nodes
- Drag-and-drop repositioning
- Zoom and pan capabilities
- Visual indicators for status, priority, and progress

#### B. List View (TODO-style)
- Hierarchical list with indentation
- Sortable columns (priority, status, due date, owner)
- Filterable by status, priority, tags
- Quick actions (mark complete, change priority)

### 3.3 Priority Management
- **Priority Levels:** Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Status Categories:** 
  - Open/Not Started
  - In Progress
  - Blocked
  - On Hold
  - Completed
  - Cancelled
- **Next Priority Queue:** Dedicated view for next actionable items

### 3.4 Link Management
- Attach multiple links to any initiative/task
- Link metadata: URL, title, description, tags
- Quick access panel for frequently used links
- Link categorization (documentation, resources, references)

### 3.5 Details Panel
- Rich text description
- Assignee(s)
- Due dates and milestones
- Progress tracking (percentage complete)
- Tags and labels
- Attachments and links
- Activity history/audit trail
- Comments/notes

### 3.6 Search & Filter
- Full-text search across all initiatives
- Filter by: status, priority, assignee, tags, date range
- Saved filter presets
- Quick filters (My Tasks, Overdue, This Week, etc.)

### 3.7 Dashboard & Analytics
- Overview of all initiatives
- Progress metrics
- Blocked items alert
- Upcoming deadlines
- Completion statistics
- Custom widgets

### 3.8 Canvas Workspaces
- Named workspaces that scope both List View and Mind Map to a subset of initiatives
- **"All" mode:** no canvas filter — all initiatives are visible across both views
- Each canvas has a name, optional description, and a color (used as accent in the UI)
- Initiatives are optionally linked to one canvas (`canvasId` nullable FK)
- Creating a canvas auto-switches the active workspace to it
- Deleting a canvas unlinks its initiatives (sets `canvasId = null`) but does not delete them
- Canvas selection persists in Redux state; both views re-fetch when it changes
- Pill-tab selector rendered at the top of both List View and Mind Map pages
- Right-click a canvas pill for Rename / Delete actions

### 3.9 Tasks View
**Architecture decision: reuse the `Initiative` table** (no separate table)
- Rationale: `type: 'TASK'` already exists; canvas, links, comments, activity, and tags work out of the box; a separate table would duplicate ~80% of the schema
- A standalone task is an `Initiative` record with `type = 'TASK'`, `parentId = null`, and `isStandaloneTask = true`
- Tasks optionally reference an initiative via `linkedInitiativeId` (separate from `parentId`) — they remain independent but carry context
- **Dedicated Tasks page** separate from the hierarchical Initiatives list
- **Checkbox UI** — checking a task sets `status = 'COMPLETED'`; unchecking sets it back to `'OPEN'`
- **Canvas scoping** — same `CanvasSelector` pill bar; tasks are filtered by `canvasId` like initiatives
- **Grouping** — tasks grouped by: Linked Initiative, Canvas, Priority, or Due Date (user-selectable)
- **Quick-add** — single-line input at the top to create a task instantly (title only, rest optional)
- Task detail opens in the same `InitiativeDetailDrawer` (links, comments, activity all available)
- Tasks are **not** shown in the Mind Map view (they are not spatial/hierarchical nodes)

### 3.10 Brainstorming Canvas

A free-form scratch-pad for ideation, separate from the structured Initiatives/MindMap views.

**Purpose:** Let users quickly sketch ideas as shapes and text, connect them with arrows, then promote finished blocks to real initiatives with one click.

**Canvas behaviour**
- Infinite free-form canvas powered by React Flow (same library as Mind Map)
- State is local (in-memory) — not persisted to the database; intentionally ephemeral
- Clearing the canvas or navigating away discards the board

**Shape palette (toolbar)**
| Shape | Use |
|---|---|
| Rectangle (Box) | Default idea block |
| Circle | Concept / key term |
| Diamond | Decision / branch point |
| Sticky Note | Quick annotation (yellow) |
| Text | Plain floating label |

**Interactions**
- Click a shape in the toolbar → click anywhere on the canvas to place it
- Double-click any shape to edit its label inline
- Drag from a node handle to another node to draw an arrow edge
- Select + `Delete`/`Backspace` to remove nodes or edges
- Multi-select with rubber-band drag or Shift+click
- Zoom + pan (mouse wheel / trackpad)
- "Clear All" button resets the canvas

**Push to Initiative**
- Select one or more nodes → "Push to Initiative" button becomes active in the toolbar
- Opens a dialog pre-filled with the node label as the title
- User can set: Title, Description, Type (INITIATIVE / TASK), Status, Priority, Canvas
- **Single node:** creates one Initiative record
- **Multiple nodes + edges:** creates a tree — edges between selected nodes determine parent-child relationships; the root node (no incoming edge from the selection) becomes the parent initiative, connected children become sub-initiatives
- On success: a success toast is shown and the pushed block(s) get a subtle ✓ badge

**Navigation:** Available in the sidebar as "Brainstorm" (Lightbulb icon)

### 3.11 AI Prioritization Suggestions ✅ Implemented

An intelligent advisor that analyses all active initiatives and surfaces the ones that need attention most urgently.

**How it works**
- Triggered by the **"AI Suggestions"** button in the Dashboard header and the Initiatives toolbar
- Opens a right-side drawer ranking up to 8 initiatives by computed urgency score
- Each suggestion shows: rank badge, status + priority chips, and up to 3 plain-English reason chips

**Scoring signals (structural)**
| Signal | Max pts | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Due date | 50 | Overdue by N days, Due today |
| Status | 38 | Blocked, On Hold |
| Priority | 40 | CRITICAL, HIGH |
| Staleness | 22 | No updates for N days |
| Blocked sub-items | 30 | 2 blocked sub-items |
| Open sub-item sprawl | 15 | 4 sub-items still open |

**LLM description analysis (Ollama)**
- All initiative descriptions are sent in a **single batched prompt** to a local Ollama model (`llama3.1:latest` by default)
- The model reads natural language intent — phrases like "must do", "scaling concern", "urgent", "at risk", "cannot wait" all raise the score
- Ollama urgency score (0–100) maps to 0–55 bonus points layered on top of structural signals
- **Graceful fallback:** if Ollama is unavailable or times out (30 s), structural scoring still runs and results are still returned
- A `🦙 Ollama` badge appears in the panel when LLM analysis successfully ran
- Configure via env vars: `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:11434`), `OLLAMA_MODEL` (default `llama3.1:latest`)

**UI**
- Reason chips use `🧠` icon for LLM-sourced signals (distinct purple tint) vs structural chips
- When a `🧠` chip fires, the matching description snippet is quoted inline below the row
- Manual Refresh button re-runs the full analysis
- Footer lists all active scoring dimensions

### 3.12 Notes ✅ Implemented

A dedicated note-taking section for capturing private thoughts, meeting notes, research, or any freeform content — separate from actionable initiatives and tasks.

**Purpose:** Give managers a structured but flexible writing space, with optional password protection for sensitive or confidential content.

**Core behaviour**
- Notes are standalone pages — not linked to initiatives or tasks
- Each note has a **title** and a **content** body
- Notes can be assigned to a **Canvas** for organisation (same `CanvasSelector` pill bar used across the app)
- The notes list shows: title, last-updated timestamp, canvas badge, and a lock icon (🔒) for protected notes
- Clicking a note opens it in a full editor panel on the right side of the page

**Canvas scoping**
- `CanvasSelector` pill bar at the top — identical pill-tab behaviour to Initiatives and Tasks
- Per-canvas counts in the canvas pills show only note counts (not initiative/task counts)
- Creating a note stamps it with the currently active canvas, if any

**Password protection (confidential notes)**
- Any note can be marked **Protected** at creation time or toggled later in the editor
- Setting protection requires choosing a password at that moment
- A protected note shows *only its title* in the list; the lock icon indicates it is locked
- Opening a locked note shows a password prompt; correct entry fetches and displays the full content
- The unlock is **session-in-memory only** — navigating away re-locks the note
- Changing protection settings (enable / disable / change password) always requires the current password first
- Passwords stored as **bcrypt hashes**; plain-text passwords are never persisted or returned
- The API never returns `content` or `passwordHash` for a locked note without successful authentication

**Note editor**
- Title editable inline at the top
- Body: full-height textarea with auto-grow
- **Auto-save** on a 1-second debounce after each keystroke; "Saved" / "Saving…" indicator
- Lock icon button in the editor header to toggle protection on the current note
- Delete note with a confirmation prompt

**Navigation:** Available in the sidebar as **"Notes"** (NoteAlt icon), route `/notes`

### Phase 10: Notes ✅ Implemented (backend) / 🚧 In Progress (frontend)
**Duration:** March 2026

**Backend**
- [x] `Note` Prisma model — `title`, `content`, `isProtected`, `passwordHash`, `canvasId` FK, `createdById` FK
- [x] `Canvas` model updated with `notes` back-relation
- [x] `User` model updated with `notes` back-relation
- [x] Database migration applied (`add_notes`)
- [x] `GET /api/notes` — list notes metadata; supports `canvasId` and `search` filters
- [x] `POST /api/notes` — create note; bcrypt-hash password when `isProtected: true`
- [x] `GET /api/notes/:id` — returns `{ locked: true }` for protected notes; full note for unprotected
- [x] `POST /api/notes/:id/unlock` — bcrypt password comparison; full note on match, `401` on mismatch
- [x] `PUT /api/notes/:id` — update any field; protection changes require `currentPassword` when currently protected
- [x] `DELETE /api/notes/:id` — owner-only deletion
- [x] `passwordHash` and `content` never exposed without authentication
- [x] Notes route registered in `server.js` at `/api/notes`

**Frontend**
- [ ] `Notes.jsx` page — `CanvasSelector` pill bar, scrollable notes list (left), editor panel (right)
- [ ] Notes list items: title, updated-at, canvas colour dot, lock icon for protected notes
- [ ] Editor: inline title field, auto-grow textarea body, 1-second auto-save debounce, "Saved / Saving…" indicator
- [ ] Password unlock dialog — shown when opening a protected note; clears on navigation
- [ ] Protection toggle in editor header — password-set dialog (new protection) or confirm-disable dialog
- [ ] `CanvasSelector` receives `countsByCanvas` (note counts) so canvas pills are accurate
- [ ] "New Note" button creates a blank note and immediately selects it in the editor
- [ ] Delete note with confirmation; deselects editor on success
- [ ] Sidebar nav entry: "Notes" (`NoteAlt` icon), route `/notes`
- [ ] Route `/notes` added to `App.jsx`

## 8. Technical Considerations

### 8.1 Performance
- **Virtualization:** For large lists (react-window or react-virtualized)
- **Pagination:** For API responses
- **Caching:** Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Debouncing:** For search and auto-save
- **Code splitting:** Lazy load routes and heavy components

### 8.2 Security
- **Authentication:** Secure JWT implementation with refresh tokens
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Input validation:** Both client and server-side
- **SQL injection prevention:** Parameterized queries
- **XSS protection:** Sanitize user input
- **HTTPS:** Enforce secure connections

### 8.3 Data Integrity
- **Orphan prevention:** Cascade delete or prevent deletion with children
- **Soft deletes:** Mark as deleted rather than hard delete
- **Audit trail:** Track all important changes
- **Backup strategy:** Regular automated backups

### 8.4 Scalability
- **Database indexing:** On frequently queried fields
- **Load balancing:** For multiple server instances
- **CDN:** For static assets
- **Microservices consideration:** For future growth

## 9. Development Workflow

### 9.1 Setup
```bash

**Version:** 1.4  
**Last Updated:** March 5, 2026  
**Status:** Draft

### Phase 11: SQLite Migration ✅ Implemented
**Duration:** March 5, 2026

Replaced PostgreSQL with a local SQLite file — no database server required.

**What changed**
- [x] `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` — datasource provider switched from `postgresql` to `sqlite`; `String[]` array fields changed to `String @default("[]")` (JSON text); `Json` fields changed to `String` (SQLite JSON1 emulation); `enum` blocks replaced with `String` fields with documentation comments
- [x] `backend/src/lib/prisma.js` — new shared Prisma client with `$extends` that auto-parses JSON text to JS objects on reads and auto-stringifies JS objects to JSON text on writes; covers `User.preferences`, `Initiative.tags`, `Link.tags`, `ActivityLog.changes`, `BrainstormCanvas.nodes/edges`
- [x] All 7 route files + `middleware/auth.js` — switched from `new PrismaClient()` per-file to importing the shared `prisma` from `../lib/prisma.js`
- [x] `backend/.env` — `DATABASE_URL` changed to `"file:./prisma/dev.db"`
- [x] `mode: 'insensitive'` removed from `contains` queries in `initiatives.js` and `notes.js` (SQLite LIKE is case-insensitive for ASCII by default)
- [x] Old PostgreSQL migrations deleted; fresh migration `20260305154749_sqlite_init` applied
- [x] SQLite database file created at `backend/prisma/dev.db`

**Setup (after this change)**  
No database server needed. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` once after cloning — it creates `prisma/dev.db` automatically. Delete `dev.db` to fully reset all data.
